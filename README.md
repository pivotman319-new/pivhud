# hi, welcome to a wip hud that i'm working on every now and then
this is a personal project of mine that i've been working on for a while now. all sources that i've used for pivhud (e.g.: GIMP xcfs, tgas, vtfs, mdls) are also provided in this repo.

so far, here's its roadmap:

- frontend
	- main menu (kinda complete, character images yet to be fleshed out)
	- loadout (half-complete, some stuff still in original tf2 style)
		- backpack (fully complete)
		- character loadout (complete)
		- item selection (not yet started)
	- store (early dev)
	- replay (absolutely nothing)
	- loading screen (complete, changes not yet merged into loadout perf stats)

- the actual ingame bit
	- barely any progress. so far, it's only the welcome screen that's taken care of and nothing else
		- speaking of the welcome screen, the changes do not work on valve servers as they enforce sv_pure 1. you might see the default blackboard in place of the FN UI instead
